# HypernovaComponentServer

## Introduction

The HypernovaComponentServer is a server that allows you to render components over http.

## Background

The HypernovaComponentServer is built on top of the great Hypernova projects from AirBnB. In the HypernovaComponentServer we use the packages:

* [hypernova-react](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova-react) - for rendering ReactJS based components
* [hypernova-amp](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova-amp) - for rendering AMP pages

# Debugging the ComponentServer

The ComponentServer implementation lives in the script **componentserver.js**. In development mode it requires the **server-bundle.js** file located next to the script.

In Visual Studio Code a **.vscode/launch.json** configuration can be added to start the debugging:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "HypernovaComponentServer",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/componentserver.js",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "-r",
                "source-map-support/register"
            ],
            "env": {
                "ComponentServerBundles": "{\"pwa\":\"./server-bundle.js\"}"
            },
            "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon",
            "restart": true,
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
            "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
                "webpack:///./~/*": "${workspaceRoot}/../Web.App/node_modules/*",
                "webpack:///./*": "${workspaceRoot}/../Web.App/*",
                "webpack:///*": "*"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that **nodemon** is used as runtime executable instead of **node**, this makes sure the server is restarted when the **server-bundle.js** file updates.

At the top of the **componentserver.js** script the **server-bundle.js** components bundle is explicitly required, so Visual Studio Code knows how to do resolve the code. Visual Studio Code does not understand dynamically required bundles.

```javascript
let bundle_to_debug = require('./server-bundle');
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    bundle_to_debug = undefined;
}
```

# Configuring the ComponentServer

The **componentserver.js** script is configured by the following environment parameters:

### process.env.NODE_ENV

The **NODE_ENV** variable can have one of two values: **development** or **production**.

### process.env.ComponentServerBundles

When the **NODE_ENV** variable is set to **development** the **ComponentServerBundles** variable is ignored and the
**server-bundle.js** bundle next to the **componentserver.js** script is used. This bundle is the only loaded bundle, so for all component render calls the specified bundle is ignored. 

When the **NODE_ENV** variable is set to **development** the **ComponentServerBundles** variable specifies the bundles to be loaded. Bundles can be either relative to the **componentserver.js** script or uri addressable bundles over http or https.

Example configuration of multiple bundles:

```json
{ "default": "./default-bundle","pwa": "./pwa-bundle", "remote": "http://myserver.com/remote-bundle.js" }
```

# Docker

The best way to do a deployment of the HypernovaComponentServer is in a Docker image. The HypernovaComponentServer project contains the scripts to build, run and deploy the hypernovacomponentserver image.

* **BuildockerImage.bat (development|production)** - builds the **hypernovacomponentserver:1.0.0** image. There are two types of images that can be built:
  * **BuildockerImage.bat development** is a fast build of the image that can be used to run locally
  * **BuildockerImage.bat production** is a (slower) build of the image that can be used to deploy to an Azure Linux Web App. This image contains an SSH server that makes t possible to connect from the Azure Web App UI over Web SSH to the running container.

  Note 1: by default a production build is done.

  Note 2: The **server-bundle.js** is created from the **BuildockerImage.bat** script. Depending on the development or production modus a development or production version of the *server-bundle.js** is created.

* **RunDockerImageLocal.bat** - run the **hypernovacomponentserver:1.0.0** as a container on http://localhost:8080. It is executed with the following parameters:
  * ```-e ComponentServerBundles={"pwa":"./server-bundle.js"}``` - so we use the **server-bundle.js** in bot the development and production version of the image running in the container.
  * ```--network bridge``` - so from the container we can access the local computer over IP address. This is useful when we need to do a service call to the host computer. It is not possible from a linux Docker container running on Windows to access a website on the host by hostname, always use http://[ip-address]:[port].
