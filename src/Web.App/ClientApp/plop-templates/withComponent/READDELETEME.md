## Todo

Congrats. You just generated your new component! A couple of things you have to keep in mind: 
- In the `{{name}}Actions.ts` and `{{name}}State.ts` the Api type is included. Check if the name is correct.
- Add `{{name}}State` to the `store/RootState.ts` file
- Add `{{camelCase name}}Reducer` to `store/store.ts`

After you did these things, delete me!
